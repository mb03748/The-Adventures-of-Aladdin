The src values for the Apple and Lamp items:
Apples src = {339, 14, 15, 18};

Lamp src = {32, 951, 52, 29};

Currently the screen work is being handled in the status function - is in game.cpp

The Jasmine class only has move function - celebration animation called through player becuase that move is in the player spritesheet. We have separate spritesheet for Jasmine though which we do her walking animation.

The different spritesheets:
items - Iassets
Jasmine- Jassets
Alien - Aassets
